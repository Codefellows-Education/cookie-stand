# cookie-stand
This is an app designed to help Pat prepair cookies for his locations broken down by hour and location. It uses a random number generated between the minimum and maximum number of people each hour and multiplies that by the average number of cookies each person buys to populate the number of cookies need each hour at each location. It also totals up the total number of cookies from all the stores by hour and by store. 

## speical thanks
I want to thank all the TA's for helping me complete this project as well as John and Amanda. I also want to thank my hubby, Adam for helping me when I got stuck. My programing group consisting of Nick, Rodger, Hanna and Katie were also super helpful. 

Your public-facing index.html page should have all of the things you'd expect such a page to have for such a business: locations with addresses, hours open, contact information, and so us. Just do mockups of these things since this is not a real business, of course.
